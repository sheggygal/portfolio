Data Analysis and Cleaning Script Documentation
Overview
This script performs data cleaning, merging, and basic analysis on two datasets. The main steps include loading the datasets, cleaning them by removing duplicates and handling missing values, merging them on a common key, and performing basic analysis. The final cleaned and merged dataset is saved as a CSV file.

requests
pandas

numpy
matplotlib
