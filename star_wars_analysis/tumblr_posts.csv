La globalizaci&oacute;n y la digitalizaci&oacute;n han transformado la manera en que operan los mercados y c&oacute;mo los individuos gestionan sus finanzas.</p><h1><b>La Evoluci&oacute;n de la Educaci&oacute;n Financiera</b></h1><p>La educaci&oacute;n financiera se ha convertido en un pilar fundamental para el &eacute;xito econ&oacute;mico personal. En el pasado, la falta de acceso a informaci&oacute;n financiera precisa y comprensible era un obst&aacute;culo. Hoy en d&iacute;a, gracias a recursos como los proporcionados por Eric Tyson, m&aacute;s personas tienen el conocimiento necesario para tomar decisiones financieras informadas.</p><h2><b>Transici&oacute;n hacia la Digitalizaci&oacute;n</b></h2><p>Con la llegada de la era digital, la gesti&oacute;n financiera ha cambiado dr&aacute;sticamente. Las aplicaciones de finanzas personales, el acceso a informaci&oacute;n en tiempo real y la posibilidad de invertir desde la comodidad del hogar han democratizado el acceso a los mercados financieros.</p><h1>Planificaci&oacute;n a Largo Plazo: Clave para el &Eacute;xito Financiero.</h1><p>La planificaci&oacute;n a largo plazo es esencial para alcanzar la estabilidad y el &eacute;xito financiero. Eric Tyson subraya la importancia de establecer metas financieras claras y crear un plan detallado para lograrlas. A continuaci&oacute;n, exploramos algunas estrategias adicionales que pueden ayudarte a gestionar tus finanzas a largo plazo.</p><h2>Establecimiento de Metas Financieras</h2><p>Tener metas financieras claras te proporciona un sentido de direcci&oacute;n y prop&oacute;sito. Estas metas pueden incluir ahorrar para la jubilaci&oacute;n, comprar una casa, pagar deudas o crear un fondo de emergencia. Al establecer metas espec&iacute;ficas y realistas, puedes crear un plan financiero que te gu&iacute;e hacia el &eacute;xito.</p><figure class=""tmblr-full""><img src=""https://64.media.tumblr.com/3095b245772f0738b6ea6cec31823418/a9c2aed6dc39e11a-e7/s640x960/59177fb404e28d77604457fdaf5a6d6af73d4bc9.png"" alt=""image"" class=""""/></figure><h1>Utilizaci&oacute;n de Herramientas Financieras Modernas</h1><p>En la era digital, existen numerosas herramientas que pueden facilitar la gesti&oacute;n de tus finanzas.

Estas herramientas son esenciales para mantener un control estricto sobre tus finanzas diarias y asegurar que est&aacute;s ahorrando adecuadamente para tus metas a largo plazo.</p><h2>Plataformas de Inversi&oacute;n Automatizadas</h2><p>Las plataformas de inversi&oacute;n automatizadas, tambi&eacute;n conocidas como robo-advisors, han revolucionado la manera en que las personas invierten. Servicios como Betterment y Wealthfront utilizan algoritmos para gestionar tu cartera de inversiones, asegurando una diversificaci&oacute;n adecuada y ajustando las inversiones seg&uacute;n las condiciones del mercado. Esto permite que incluso los inversores novatos puedan beneficiarse de estrategias de inversi&oacute;n avanzadas sin necesidad de ser expertos en finanzas.</p><h1>Importancia del Seguimiento y la Revisi&oacute;n</h1><p>La planificaci&oacute;n financiera no es un proceso est&aacute;tico.

Misogynistic behavior </p><p>Summery: You had been employed by the Mandalorian for about a year before being captured by imperial troopers. They had wanted you for your knowledge of engineering, but once word got around to Moff Gideon that you had knowledge of the child, you were taken for questioning. </p><p>Questioning was a generous word&hellip; they tortured you for information about the child&rsquo;s whereabouts and his Beskar protector. During long days in your imperial cell you recalled happy memories you&rsquo;d made with your boys.</p><blockquote><p><b>Grogu says his first word</b></p></blockquote><p><i>&ldquo;Din!&rdquo; You shout from the hull. Din jumps down from the cockpit not bothering with any of the rungs on the latter. His boots hit the floor &ldquo;what? Are you okay?&rdquo;By the sound of your voice he assumed something was wrong. You look up at him from the floor where you were squatted down, playing with the child. &ldquo;Grogu just said his first word.&rdquo; You say with wide eyes. Din kneels down to his son&rsquo;s level &ldquo;okay let&rsquo;s here it&rdquo; Grogu looks back at you for assurance and then squawks the word &ldquo;Din&rdquo; you look over at Din with teary eyes &ldquo;seeeee&rdquo; Din chuckles. He&rsquo;s always loved getting to see that tender side of you. He considers it a privilege after you spent so much of your life putting up walls just to survive. Din rubs his child&rsquo;s head &ldquo;good work buddy&rdquo; and then climbs back up to the cockpit. </i></p><p>A smile tugs at the corner of your mouth as you recall the memory. It&rsquo;s short lived. A guard bangs on the bars. &ldquo; it&rsquo;s dinner time, brat&rdquo; a nickname you&rsquo;ve earned after punching one of the guards in the throat for letting his hand slide a bit too low when guiding you back to your cell. And you&rsquo;d do it again. You silently rise and exit your cell as the guard follows you to the cafeteria. He doesn&rsquo;t try and touch you. You know Din would be proud of you. He had spent many hours teaching you to fight. It was too painful to think of him anymore. You missed him so much. Din was the closest friend you&rsquo;d ever had in this fucked up life, a fact you reminded yourself of when that little nagging voice in the back of your mind whispered you <i>know you love him as more than a friend. </i>No, you&rsquo;d argue back with yourself, this is just a side effect of being imprisoned. All my feelings are simply magnified. It&rsquo;s not that I long for him because I love him, I long for him because I long for freedom&hellip;and I miss the old life he represents. </p><p>You picked around at your dinner. It looked nasty but you knew you needed to keep your strength up. You had already lost too much weight, you could see it in your hips. You forced the food down before you were marched back to your cell for the night. How long had it been? You stopped keeping track after 3 months. Maybe 5 months? 6? It was hard to tell. You let your eyes close knowing tomorrow would be just as miserable as today. You tried to conjure up a happy memory that you hoped would seep into your dreams. A memory you held particularly close to your heart popped into your head&hellip;</p><blockquote><p><b>Din teaches you to dance</b> </p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>I don&rsquo;t understand what this has to do with fighting&rdquo; you complained as you followed din down the ramp. He was taking a break from jobs and decided to lay low on a quiet planet where you and Grogu could stretch your legs for a bit. On breaks like this he always took advantage of the open space to train you more. &ldquo;Because. It has to do with coordination. This is how I learned to fight.&rdquo; You looked Din up and down, somehow you couldn&rsquo;t picture him dancing, yet you understand the shared skill that coordination held between fighting and dancing. You signed &ldquo;okay but I&rsquo;m not much of a dancer.&rdquo; You set Grogu down and took Din&rsquo;s outstretched hand. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m teaching you&rdquo; Din had brought his portable radio and turned it to a station with slow music. &ldquo;Relax&rdquo; he chuckled. &ldquo;Do you not trust me?&rdquo; You trusted him with your life. &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re the only person I&rsquo;ve ever trusted actually.&rdquo; He caressed your hand gently with his thumb, understanding exactly how that felt. You felt heat rise in your chest &ldquo;okay&hellip;let&rsquo;s get on with this&rdquo; you could have been imagining it, but you could have sworn that Din was extra attentive to you that afternoon, after you had made the comment about having only trusted one person. Later that evening, the three of you lay out under the stars. Grogu had tucked himself under his Dads arm and was now snorting softly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never had someone quite like you before.&rdquo; Din whispered. You turned your head to face him &ldquo;how do you mean?&rdquo; There was a beat of silence before he answered &ldquo;such a close friend.&rdquo; Your chest filled with warmth &ldquo;yeah me neither&rdquo; you reached out and squeezed his hand and Din squeezed it back. </i></p><p>&ldquo;Rise and shine, sweetheart!&rdquo; Every day they took you to a location where you did engineering work. They had mostly given up on torturing you for answers about the kid, they figured if you were this loyal to the Mandalorian they might as well keep you as bait. Your night in shining armor would likely come try and bust you out, or at least that&rsquo;s what they were holding out for&hellip;it had been months though. It&rsquo;s not like you wanted Din to risk his heck for you. You wondered if he still cared about you. </p><p>Your work was a good distraction. Today&rsquo;s job was relatively easy and you were able to let your mind drift far away from your monotonous task. You decide to revisit the memory you had been thinking of last night, the one where Din taught you to dance. </p><p><i>&ldquo;Alright, nice and slow. I step forward and you step &hellip;back. Perfect just like that. Watch my feet and mirror what they do. Good. Now try and do it without looking.&rdquo; &ldquo;Din that&rsquo;s impos-  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so stubborn&hellip;just look at me.&rdquo; And you did. In that moment you had never wanted to see his face more. How was he looking at you? You wanted so badly to know. &ldquo;Okay. Hand placement.&rdquo; Din continued. He gently put one hand on your waist and took your free hand in his. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to have to get a little close for this to work.&rdquo; Din&rsquo;s arm was almost fully outstretched to reach your waist. &ldquo;Come hereeeeeee. I&rsquo;m not going to hurt you.&rdquo; He said as he pulled you to himself. You laughed nervously. It wasn&rsquo;t like this was your first time being this close to him. You lived in a ship for goodness sakes. Quarters were cramped and it wasn&rsquo;t uncommon that the two of you worked side by side, squished together trying to fix some electrical problem on the crest. You found dancing with him started to come incredibly naturally, like the two of you had done this ever night for years. &ldquo;Yes, yes that&rsquo;s so good!&rdquo; You felt sheepish under his flattery. </i></p><p>&ldquo;Hey 1187, get back to work!&rdquo; You hadn&rsquo;t even noticed it, but in your dreaming you had entirely stalled your work and had been simply staring into space. For the remainder of the day you forced yourself to focus on the task at hand. That evening you overheard some of the guards saying Moff Gideon had arrived on base. Why the hell was he here? Overseeing the prison is a little below his pay grade. Then you heard them say &ldquo;yeah he wants to question the girl himself.&rdquo; Oh fuck &hellip;sounds like he was here for you. After dinner you weren&rsquo;t led back to your cell, you were led into a dark room and handcuffed to a table. Moff entered the room. You stared him down, refusing to appear weak. &ldquo;Are you enjoying your stay?&rdquo; You spat &ldquo;oh dear, I take that as a no. They told me you were a little brat. I will make this very simple for you&hellip;tell us any information you have on the Mandalorian and the child he is in procession of, or die a most painful death.&rdquo; You smirked. &ldquo;What good am I to you dead?&rdquo; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re no good to use any longer, you have injured countless of my guards, you&rsquo;re a self righteous brat, and you have proven your silence on this notion. You are becoming a hindrance to me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Kill me if you like, but you can kiss goodbye your plan to use me as bait for Mando to come rescue me.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Oh I think we both know that ship has sailed. Your Mandalorian likely has a new little whore at this point&hellip;I doubt he&rsquo;s coming back for you.&rdquo; You breath quickened. You knew Moff was trying to break you down, and his words were starting to strike very close to the insecurities already dwelling in the back of your mind. &ldquo;Go to hell. I&rsquo;m not telling you shit.&rdquo; Moff signaled to one of the guards who used his rod to electrify you. You screamed as the pain ripped through your body. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try again.&rdquo; He said in an eerily calm voice. He calmly removed one of his black leather gloves and then without warning smacked you across the face. &ldquo;Tell me where he is. I don&rsquo;t think you understand how important the child is to me, but I will make you understand.&rdquo; You kept your gaze fixed on him but said nothing. &ldquo;Right well I have other matters to attend to. I will check back in with you in a couple hours to see if you&rsquo;ve had a change of heart.&rdquo; With that he moved to exit the interrogation room. &ldquo;Take her back to her cell and put her in the restraints.&rdquo; </p><p>Back in your cell they had you chained to three wall. You found it hard not to feel defeated. You refused to let that emotion take up any space in your body, but tonight felt different. You were tired, you were ready to give in and silently accept death with your head hanging low. You could feel yourself drifting in and out of consciousness. You were pretty sure they had drugged you, before putting you in the restraints. Your head hung low to your chest and you felt as though you could almost fall asleep when all the lights turned red and sirens blared in the hall. Your head jerked up. &ldquo;Are we being attacked?&rdquo; You wondered to yourself. You heard shooting and other sounds of a struggle, and then silence. Two men rounded the corner. One man was bald and had a slight beard, the other &hellip;the other was your Mandalorian! You could have cried. Din saw you almost immediately. &ldquo;Here!&rdquo; He and the other man rushed towards your cell. The bald man used his comlink &ldquo;Dune, do you copy? Open cell 1187&rdquo; the door swung open moments later. You were at a loss for words. Din knelt down and began to work at your restraints while the other man kept watch. &ldquo;Hey, we&rsquo;re going to get you out of here okay.&rdquo; He said softly. All you could do was nod. Tears threatened to spill over. Din worked quickly &ldquo;Mayfield how we doing?&rdquo; He called over his shoulder. &ldquo;Fine for now, but pick it up.&rdquo; The last restraint fell to the floor &ldquo;okay can you run?&rdquo; Din stood up and held out his hand to you. &ldquo;I think so.&rdquo; Mayfield used the comlink again. &ldquo;Alright Dune we&rsquo;re headed your way. Need you to be ready to jump to hyperspace the second we get back to the crest.&rdquo; &ldquo;Copy that&rdquo; a woman&rsquo;s voice responded. </p><p>The dash to escape the prison was a blur. You weren&rsquo;t sure if it was the drugs, the chemicals in your brain or both, but before you knew it you were sitting in the hull of the razor crest panting. &ldquo;Alright get us the fuck out of here!&rdquo; Mayfield called. Din quickly scaled the ladder and in moments you were in hyperspace. The last thing you remember is Din calling your name before you hit the cold, metal floor. </p>",14,0,0

Image from The Book of Boba Fett, Season 1, Episode 1,  Stranger in a Strange Land. Calendar by DateWorks.</p><p>Grogu couldn&rsquo;t count how many times he&rsquo;d heard the advice, &ldquo;Things would go a lot smoother if you accepted their ways.&rdquo; People didn&rsquo;t always say it that way of course, but the meaning was the same. Don&rsquo;t argue, don&rsquo;t change, don&rsquo;t offend, don&rsquo;t be different. He hated this advice. He was surprised that Fennec had ever said to Daimyo Fett. When was the last time that she accepted anyone else&rsquo;s way of doing something?</p><p>The first question he always had was why was something being &lsquo;smooth&rsquo; worth the trouble of accepting something that was unacceptable? The second question he always had was why did people recommend this when they were talking about folks who were currently in power? No one ever asked other people to accept Grogu&rsquo;s way of doing things. That didn&rsquo;t seem fair.</p><p>Sure, he and the Mandalorian were very different people. The ways the Jedi and Mandalorians did things were very different. But as far as Grogu could tell, each group had strengths and weaknesses. How would you learn a better way to do things if you always followed someone else? Or if you only followed your own culture?&nbsp;</p><p>Uff. He groaned at that thought. This sort of thing always cut both ways. If you accepted someone else&rsquo;s ways then you could blend in, evaluate, and not get in trouble. But what if their way was about being cruel to small green boys who were just trying to make their way in a large, mostly hostile, galaxy? The Imps had been in control of their galaxy for half (ish) of Grogu&rsquo;s life. Should he have become an Inquisitor just to make things &lsquo;smooth&rsquo; for himself?&nbsp;</p><p>He didn&rsquo;t think that was a very good idea. On the other hand, he might have been able to help the Mandalorian retrieve the parts to the Razor Crest if he&rsquo;d been able to be accepted by the Jawas and followed their ways, at least for enough time to get that stuff back. And, the Jawas wouldn&rsquo;t have been disrupted for real. Now that had value.&nbsp;</p><p>Grogu didn&rsquo;t know who to talk to about this kind of thing. If he talked to his dad, the Mandalorian would explain that the Creed was the Creed. When he was young boy he&rsquo;d sworn to uphold it. He took being honorable seriously and had done his best over his life to fulfill that pledge.&nbsp;</p><p>But he&rsquo;d broken that pledge when Grogu asked him to. He&rsquo;d taken his helmet off and let people see his face. Let Grogu see his face. From Grogu&rsquo;s perspective that was very honorable. It just wasn&rsquo;t honorable under the Mandalorian Creed. So how could that happen? Here it&rsquo;s okay; there it&rsquo;s not okay? It was very confusing.</p><p>He would have asked the Daimyo or Fennec about it, but it was clear that they both agreed and disagreed with the sentiment. It was like they had their own personal Creed and they followed it as best they could. If it didn&rsquo;t help, they changed. Sort of. When they gave their word it was worth something. They had both helped his dad save him from the Imps. Grogu would call that honorable.</p><p>Grogu thought about talking to the Majordomo or Peli, or even the rancor trainer, but none of them were available and he was pretty sure that they would have just confused him even more. Peli would have said that she always made things smoother for her customers. That&rsquo;s why she spoke so many languages and understood so many customs. But she also had the Jawas steal and resell parts for their ships and speeders because &lsquo;Baby needs a new pair of boots&rsquo; and her nickname was &lsquo;Baby&rsquo; according to the pit droids.</p><p>If he asked the Majordomo, Grogu was certain that he would get the longest answer that wasn&rsquo;t an answer. It was a skill that people trained in diplomacy honed and practiced according to Fennec. Grogu had witnessed that up close and personal and didn&rsquo;t need a refresher.&nbsp;</p><p>Which is why he thought about talking to the rancor trainer. But then he recalled their last conversation about a fairly esoteric topic related to morals, beliefs, and actions. The trainer&rsquo;s reply had been short and to the point. He became a rancor trainer because it required less nuance than working for the Imps. You feed a rancor. You run it through training exercises. You praise it. Give it treats and let it sleep. Then you do it all over again. Simple. Consistent. Unremarkable.</p><p>Grogu envied him the ability to be focused on just one thing. But when you curiosity is as large as your coverall, you ponder things and investigate and try to learn.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Know your priorities. The Force will guide you.&rdquo;</p><p>Ahhh. Grogu had wondered if the Monks had heard him thinking so loudly as he wondered about their monastery. He looked around and saw the spider-like droid with the monk&rsquo;s brain in a jar mounted to it&rsquo;s underbelly just passing through an archway, as it scuttled away from Grogu&rsquo;s position.&nbsp;</p><p>Grogu supposed that was the best advice he could have hoped for. He had to know what he wanted from himself and what he would accept from others. He knew the Force would want him to remain in balance with it and that meant making choices that supported that balance. You couldn&rsquo;t always say yes. You couldn&rsquo;t always say no. But some times you said yes, when you had once said no because things had changed enough to require a different answer.&nbsp;</p><p>He sighed. That was a lot of thinking.

Calendar from DateWorks.</p><p>Grogu didn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d ever be allowed to run along the top of a transport train. For one thing it was very dangerous. For another it would take him forever to get wherever he was supposed to go. He was glad that the Mandalorian wasn&rsquo;t with him when Boba Fett told him about the time he helped his tribe of Sand People stop the movement of spice across their lands on Tatooine.&nbsp;</p><p>Daimyo Fett described it as a turning point in his relationship with the Sand People and Grogu could understand that. He was no longer just doing things for his own convenience. He was helping the Sand People because he&rsquo;d learned to care about them and how they lived in such a harsh environment. It was always better to be a volunteer.&nbsp;</p><p>Well, almost always. There was that time&hellip;</p><p>HA! You thought Grogu was going to tell you a story about his time at the Jedi Temple and some sort of lesson that he&rsquo;d learned with the help of his friend Ian. It was understandable. He&rsquo;d told plenty of those stories. But not this time. Nope.</p><p>This time the story was very different. Really. He promises.&nbsp;</p><p>It was a beautiful, sunny day on Corellia when the ship landed with Grogu&rsquo;s pram. He only knew that because he&rsquo;d managed to peak out of it for a moment, before the cover was shut so no one could see him. He didn&rsquo;t like being closed away like that, but it was Master Beq&rsquo;s call, not his. He&rsquo;d never been to Corellia before and he was curious about it. Very curious. But they left the ship and he had no idea what that part of Corellia really looked like.</p><p>That didn&rsquo;t matter, however. They needed to get to wherever they going. The attack on the Jedi Temple wasn&rsquo;t going to remain a secret for long and Grogu expected that people, most likely Clones, would be searching for them sooner, rather than later. No doubt that was why Master Beq had closed the pram.&nbsp;</p><p>He could sense that they were traveling at a pretty good speed along a side walk or something like one when they just stopped. Thunk. He &lsquo;thunked&rsquo; the inside of the pram because he hadn&rsquo;t been prepared for a sudden stop. That was one of the problems with the pram being in it&rsquo;s closed configuration.</p><p>Grogu supposed that he could have reached out to the Force and used it to help him understand what was going on, but his ears were still ringing with Master Beq&rsquo;s command that he not access the Force under any circumstance. It was too dangerous and their enemies could be anywhere. That wasn&rsquo;t an order Grogu was going to ignore, just to gaze at scenery, no matter how much he really wanted to do just that.&nbsp;</p><p>The next time the pram cover opened, they were in another ship and Corellia was fading into a small speck. Grogu sighed. He should have expected that to happen. They weren&rsquo;t going to stay on any planet&nbsp; that close to Coruscant. They needed to be pretty far away as quickly as possible, but Grogu had no idea where they would end up.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re on our way to Naboo. We&rsquo;ll be making stops along the way, but that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re headed. The Gungans have agreed to watch over you. They can be trusted. We&rsquo;ll be making our next jump into hyperspace momentarily. I&rsquo;m sorry I can&rsquo;t explain more to you, Grogu, but I don&rsquo;t know much more than I&rsquo;ve already explained.&rdquo;</p><p>Just as Master Beq said that a light flashed green and a bell rang.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay. Here we go.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Master Beq activated the hyperdrive and the ship&hellip; did nothing. It should have slipped into hyperspace. But it hadn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m running a diagnostic. If we can&rsquo;t fix this I have no idea what will happen.&rdquo;</p><p>That hadn&rsquo;t sounded good. Seconds turned into tens of seconds and tens of seconds turned into a full minute and a full minute was about to turn into a minute and a half when Master Beq groaned.</p><p>&ldquo;Grogu. I need you to do something. There is a loose wire on the input side of the hyperdrive activation sequencer. I need you to crawl into the maintenance chase and push the input power cable on that activation sequencer back into full contact. Can you do that? If you&rsquo;re afraid or think it&rsquo;s too hard, I&rsquo;ll figure out a work around.&rdquo;</p><p>Dank Farrik! If there was one thing Grogu disliked more than being closed into the pram for long periods of time, it was being in other spaces that were cramped, dark, with a lot of protruding equipment, sharp edges, and strange sounds.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, he really didn&rsquo;t want to just float around in space waiting for a squad of Clone Troopers to show and start blasting away at them. He&rsquo;d seen enough blaster fire for a lifetime and his people had very long lifetimes under normal circumstances.&nbsp;</p><p>Grogu took a deep breath and unbuckled his seat belt. He hopped down to the deck of the bridge and waited for Master Beq to open the access port, a small panel that wasn&rsquo;t even fifteen centimeters wide. Grogu quickly got out of his coverall, grateful for his first layer being clean and stepped up to do the work.&nbsp;</p><p>His friend Ian would have called what Master Beq did &lsquo;Voluntelling&rsquo;, but Grogu preferred to think of it as being another test of his abilities as a Jedi.&nbsp; He just hoped that wire was still blue in this model of the ST-70 gunship. If it wasn&rsquo;t, he was going to have problems. But like Boba Fett, he had a responsibility, as a Jedi in his case, to take of the people who took care of him. So he volunteered.&nbsp;</p><p>See, Jedi and Mandalorians actually have a lot in common.&nbsp;</p></p>",3,0,0

Most people who weren&rsquo;t raised by the Jedi thought it was pretty straight forward. It&rsquo;s energy just waiting around to be used by anyone trained to use it. Like a light source or a power supply. It seemed simple because the explanation of the Force being energy that was created by every living thing is pretty simple.&nbsp;</p><p>That&rsquo;s what the Jedi told people who weren&rsquo;t Jedi. Simple. Neat. Packaged. Easy to digest. No mystery there.&nbsp;</p><p>So how the heck had Peli Motto found out that the Force was actually deceptive and complicated? Who told her? Someone blabbed and Grogu knew it wasn&rsquo;t him. He also didn&rsquo;t think that it would have been Obi-Wan. Master Kenobi was happy to let folks think the Force was like electricity. Not complicated but dangerous if used foolishly.&nbsp;</p><p>But Grogu knew that the Force was complicated. It was also dangerous, but that wasn&rsquo;t just because someone was being foolish. Nope. You could be doing something in a very serious, thoughtful manner, and the Force would put you on your butt and tell you not to get up until you learned to respect it. That had happened to Grogu more than once or twice.&nbsp;</p><p>He thought about his first lesson with a training saber and how focused and thoughtful he was trying to be, but to no avail. He had tried holding the small wooden saber as the other younglings did, but it was still twice his height, so when he held it down it thumped on the floor. The master teaching them had frowned at him. Then they were commanded to brandish the weapon in front of themselves and he accidentally hit the youngling standing to that side. They fell down because of course Grogu had hit them right behind the knee. Oops.&nbsp;</p><p>The younglings were commanded to take two more steps away from each other. Grogu didn&rsquo;t move at all. He was standing in the middle of an empty circle. None of the other younglings wanted to get hit by him. They had taken three steps. He remembered trying to focus again on not hitting himself, the floor, or anyone in the room. That&rsquo;s when the Force decided that the lesson was not going the way it wanted things to go.&nbsp;</p><p>The lesson started up again. A simple request to hold the wooden saber horizontally, centered across your body. Grogu did that and was quite happy about it. No thumping against the floor. No whacking a fellow student. No floating above the floor&hellip; Oops! He was definitely floating above the floor. He hadn&rsquo;t meant to do that.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Youngling Grogu. Empty your mind. Return to the floor immediately.&rdquo;</p><p>What? Grogu was confused. Was he supposed to empty his mind or return to the floor? Or did he have to do both and in that order? He guessed that he was so supposed to do both and in that order, but the Force had other ideas.&nbsp;</p><p>When you are using the Force and empty your mind a couple of things can happen. You can stop everything you&rsquo;re doing and return to some base status, like standing on the floor. Or&hellip; you can float up until your head hits the ceiling of the room, drop anything you&rsquo;re holding and then fall to the floor like a rock, landing on whatever you dropped. Grogu did the &lsquo;or&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p><p>The thump was awful. But it wasn&rsquo;t worse than a couple of the other younglings rushing over to check on him and slipping on the wooden saber that his coverall was partially covering because he had landed on it when he fell. The &lsquo;oof&rsquo; and &lsquo;ouch&rsquo; were almost as bad as the thump. And the clatter of their sabers falling filled the room with an awful sound. He wondered why the Force thought that was a lesson he needed to learn.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course he got back to his feet. Apologized to the two who had fallen on top of him and then apologized to the whole class for causing a distraction. Their instructor asked him to go to the back of the room and simply sit and watch the rest of the class as they were instructed on what to do. Grogu had agreed and trotted to the back of the room, sat down and held his practice saber across his lap. If this is what his instructor wanted then that&rsquo;s what he would get. Except the Force didn&rsquo;t agree.&nbsp;</p><p>Grogu was simply watching the class go through the various poses and saber positions, and tried to remember the names that their master was calling out so he could match them to actions he would take when it was safe for him to practice.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Swing Down Right&rdquo;, &ldquo;Thrust Upward Left&rdquo;, &ldquo;Quarter Turn, Thrust&rdquo;, &ldquo;Half Turn Slash&rdquo;, &ldquo;Block Left&rdquo;, &ldquo;Block Right&rdquo;, &ldquo;Jump&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p><p>That last command to &ldquo;jump&rdquo; was something the Force had been waiting for apparently. All of the other younglings jumped. Only Grogu remained on the ground. But instead of landing, the other younglings remained in the air. Floating.&nbsp;</p><p>Grogu didn&rsquo;t know what the heck was going on, but it didn&rsquo;t matter. At just that moment Master Yoda entered the class.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Mysterious the Force is. Unpredictable. Do not forget this lesson.&rdquo;</p><p>Then the Jedi Master raised one hand and the younglings began to slowly descend to the floor. Grogu was very impressed, until he looked over at his own left hand and realized that he had been the reason the other younglings had been floating. He slowly lowered his hand.&nbsp;</p><p>Master Yoda called to their instructor and they both walked over to Grogu, who was quite embarrassed about what had happened.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;All students must learn and you must see them all to teach them. In the front he shall be placed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course Master Yoda. My apologies.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Learn we all through life. Patience he will teach you. Thoughtfulness. Padawans we all are when new masters we find.&rdquo;</p><p>Was that it? Was Peli really a master? And Din Djarin was her padawan? If that was the case, then the Force really was mysterious.</p><figure class=""tmblr-full""><img src=""https://64.media.tumblr.com/826bb74348e46037f2b01ba438dc9dd4/c83787ed0c82eaf3-8c/s640x960/a0dd3a556e4ce6456a744088461f6f1830731cea.jpg"" alt=""image"" class=""""/></figure><p>Din Djarin holding onto the back of a mech driven carriage, while Peli Motto aims a blaster at a Scorpanek Droid, on the Streets of Mos Espa, Tatooine.

He&rsquo;d done that dozens, if not hundreds, of times. The amazing child, who came into his life and flipped upside down with a single &lsquo;coo&rsquo;, loved to document everything he interacted with in sketches and drawings.&nbsp;</p><p>They weren&rsquo;t all the same quality. And the Mandalorian was certain that&rsquo;s why there were so many of them. Quantity could resolve issues that skill hadn&rsquo;t been able to address yet. The only time he didn&rsquo;t enjoy this part of their time together is when they had to down select images for placement on the preserver. Then the arguments (Greef Karga would have called them discussions) were often repetitious and frustrating.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Grogu, we already have a sketch of the Razor Crest on the preserver. Do you want to take the old one down and put the new one in its place?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want me to take the down the sketch you did of Fennec when the Majordomo gave her that box from Peli that ended up having a dead womp rat in it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then which picture is coming down?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>Why Karga ever gave the kid that button, the Mandalorian would never really understand or forgive. He really preferred being coo&rsquo;d at or chattered at or even growled at. But that mechanical &lsquo;no&rsquo; in IG-11&rsquo;s voice was just too much.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay. Have it your way, kid. The new one can&rsquo;t go up there.&rdquo;</p><p>The Mandalorian remembered the first time he made that argument with Grogu. The little guy seemed to deflate and his ears drooped and he shuffled off to beg clutching the pile of drawings he thought could go the surface of something smaller than an astro-mech. He had hoped the disappointment would help his apprentice appreciate that hard decisions were necessary. He had hoped.&nbsp;</p><p>The next morning when he entered Grogu&rsquo;s room to wake him up so they could head out to scout more of the old Imp Base on Nevarro, he realized abruptly just how wrong he had been. Grogu had taped, pastes, fastened, and some how stuck, every one of those drawings on the walls, floor, doors, and ceiling of his small room.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Buddy! How are you going to move around the room without damaging all these things?&rdquo; Din Djarin had asked from the doorway, annoyed and secretly proud of Grogu&rsquo;s ingenuity.&nbsp;</p><p>Grogu opened his eyes wide, grinned a toothy grin, and held up one hand and proceeded to float from the bed to the dresser so he could claim his coverall. Then he floated back to the bed.&nbsp;</p><p>Dank Farrik! Of course the kid could use the Force! Not just could, had. He had used the Force all night long to get everything just right. Just right until he drew just one more sketch and now it all had to be redone. Fortunately, IG-11-M stopped by with some protectors for the drawings and Grogu spent a happy afternoon organizing them while the bounty hunter cooled his beskar covered heels on the front porch. No one wanted him to damage any of the artworks with bootprints.&nbsp;</p><p>He looked more closely at this latest drawing and began to chuckle.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Buddy, is that the sand-beast Fett told you about the last time we were on Tatooine?&rdquo;</p><p>Grogu nodded his head but stayed focused on the artwork he was busy creating.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Did Fett actually show you any vids of the critters when he told you about the one he saved the Tusken kid from?&rdquo;</p><p>Grogu turned away from the paper to stare at him, a frown creasing his brow.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry. Sand People. When he saved the child of the Sand People tribe who adopted him.&rdquo;</p><p>Tuskens vs Sand People was an argument the Mandalorian had last a long time ago and even with Grogu&rsquo;s consistent reinforcement he still slipped up from time to time.&nbsp;</p><p>Grogu shook his head &lsquo;no&rsquo;. Whew. A head shake. That was much better than hearing the button say &lsquo;No, No, No, No&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I see. I think we should consider saving this one for Daimyo Fett and bring it to him the next time we go to Tatooine. I&rsquo;m certain it would look great in the throne room. You can give it to him for his next naming day.&rdquo;</p><p>Grogu looked up at him smiling and hit the other button.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>The Mandalorian chuckled again.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Good. I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll enjoy it. And Fennec too. When you&rsquo;re done how &lsquo;bout we go catch some frogs and I&rsquo;ll tell you stories about training with the Flying Corps?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Okay. Okay. I&rsquo;ll be on the front porch when you&rsquo;re ready.&rdquo;</p><p>Din Djarin wondered if Grogu could sense his amusement at the way the drawing was turning out or not. It was hard to tell. He tried hard not to laugh at things that weren&rsquo;t quite perfect. Grogu put so much work into them. But he really wondered if Fett understood that in telling Grogu about that very dramatic incident in his life he was setting the boy&rsquo;s imagination on fire? The Mandalorian doubted it. Otherwise, the sandbeast would have only had it&rsquo;s customer one head, six appendages, and no tail. The one he&rsquo;d inspired had three heads, at least twelve appendages, and no fewer than seven tails. It also looked like it was wearing beskar armor of some sort. Additionally, Fett himself looked to be about the size of scurrier in a flight pack.&nbsp;</p><p>It might not be accurate, but it more than made up for that with a triple helping of drama and wasn&rsquo;t that what you wanted from a good story, no matter what form it took? The boy who wore beskar armor sure did.</p><p>Happy Father&rsquo;s Day to all who take on that role. May the Force be with you.</p></p>",3,0,0

Boba Fett is depicted as strangling a sand-beast with the heavy chain he wore while being held by the Sand People. The Sand-Beast is a six-limbed lizard, with humanoid body structures.</p><p>Grogu had heard of sand-beasts, but he never thought he&rsquo;d ever meet anyone who had actually seen one, up close and personal. They had been a topic of hot discussion in the Evolutionary Biology of Humans course that he&rsquo;d taken as an elective one summer. Since he wasn&rsquo;t a human, he was very curious about how they had evolved, what they had evolved from and what their future might hold for them.&nbsp;</p><p>Master Chobin taught the course to the first and third forms of younglings. At the time he took it, Grogu had been part of the third form, while Ian, for reasons Grogu never quite understood, was part of the first form. Master Chobin claimed it was because Ian&rsquo;s records had been lost and she just had to treat the youngling like he was brand new to the Temple. Grogu remembered kind of huffing at the kindly master when that was explained because he&rsquo;d never heard of any records ever being lost at the Jedi Temple. Ian, on the other hand, hadn&rsquo;t cared at all. Which Grogu found confusing. But enough of that.&nbsp;</p><p>Master Chobin was a Mirialan with deep, deep, faded purple skin and the most amazing yellow hair Grogu had ever seen. She was very soft spoken and taught all the biology courses for the younglings and padawans. She had tiny diamond tattoos all over her skin and he sometimes wondered what they meant. Ian, on the other hand, wondered if she ever played &lsquo;connect the dots&rsquo; when she was bored.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;For many years, scientists on Tatooine, have traced, studied, measured, and observed the &lsquo;sand-beast&rsquo; at all its various points of maturity. One thing that we can say for certain about the creature is that it is not-closely related to humans, but it is related to a distant human off-shoot species that no longer exists.&rdquo;</p><p>She continued to drone on and on in her gentle voice, while Ian quizzed Grogu on whether or not he&rsquo;d ever seen one, what they smelled like, if they were really stronger than a bantha, and other such nonsense. Grogu had advised Ian to listen to the lecture, but found that he also hadn&rsquo;t actually heard their instructor provide any meaningful information about the critter.&nbsp;</p><p>For example. Did it eat sitting down or standing up? Could you tell which way it was going based on which exterminates it used to walk? However it did eat, what did it eat to get so gosh darned big? If you asked it politely enough would it give you a ride on it&rsquo;s first or second set of shoulders?&nbsp;</p><p>He wasn&rsquo;t sorry Ian was asking these questions, but he was sorry that he couldn&rsquo;t write them down before Master Chobin stared at them both and asked them if they had something they wanted to share with the class?&nbsp;</p><p>Grogu politely shook his head and tried to memorize the questions that Ian had just rattled off, while Ian stood up and said, &ldquo;Ya. Did you say whether or not these critters show up in all sand piles or just sand piles on Tatooine?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I indicated that while they are located and evolved on Tatooine and prefer to soak in the sand of that planet, there has been little to no research on their introduction to other planets possessing the requisite climate.&rdquo;</p><p>Master Chobin actually seemed pleased by Ian&rsquo;s question, which had surprised Grogu.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure. But what does that mean? For example, I happen to know where there is a really big pile of sand here on Coruscant. If that pile of sand had originally come from say, a planet with twin suns and a lot of spare sand, what&rsquo;s the likelihood that I&rsquo;d find a sand-beast in it?&rdquo;</p><p>Grogu never heard what Master Chobin replied because the other younglings became very engaged in the conversation. Apparently they had heard a rumor that a huge pile of sand had been deposited in one of the back gardens of the Temple, somewhere near the base level of the structure, but none of them had seen it and they certainly hadn&rsquo;t been told that it was a hive of sand beasts. Grogu didn&rsquo;t know that you called more than one sand beast a &lsquo;hive&rsquo;.</p><p>Know, all these years later, he knew Boba Fett. The Daimyo of Mos Espa and essentially the unofficial/official leader of Tatooine. The Daimyo had just told him how he&rsquo;d saved a child of the Sandpeople from a rampaging sand-beast. That&rsquo;s how the mysterious desert nomads began to view him as trustworthy. He could finally get all of those questions answered. It was almost too exciting.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Young one, you&rsquo;re hopping up and down like you have sand in your first layer! What is vexing you?&rdquo; The Daimyo asked, studying him with an experienced eye.</p><p>Grogu blurted out the first question he could think of and then hoped it wasn&rsquo;t possible to actually perish from embarrassment.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Where?

Image from The Book of Boba Fett, Season 1, Episode 3, The Streets of Mos Espa. Calendar by DataWorks.</p><p>Grogu thought about that question. What kind of leader would he be? Would he be fair and kind and thoughtful? Would he be humble, a good listener, willing to take action when it was required? Would he share with everyone? Would he help people, even his enemies, to be better and happier? He didn&rsquo;t know. It wasn&rsquo;t a mystery or even a puzzle. He had never considered himself a leader and if he was being brutally honest, he&rsquo;d never noticed anyone but ex-Imps following him anywhere.&nbsp;</p><p>Because that was really the thing about being a leader. You can&rsquo;t be one if no one follows you. You could certainly be a scout or an adventurer. You could be a lot of things, good or bad. But leaders require followers and that was always the problem. What kind of followers would Grogu attract?</p><p>Would they be kind? Smart? Funny? Or would they just want to use him for whatever they could get from him? That certainly seemed to be why bounty hunters and a particular flavor of ex-Imperial War Lord followed him around.&nbsp;</p><p>That made him wonder if he was Din Djarin&rsquo;s leader or if it was the other way around? Certainly the Mandalorian had found him on Arvala-7. Then he&rsquo;d brought Grogu back to Nevarro and handed him off to someone else. The people who had been following him almost everywhere, although they obviously hadn&rsquo;t worked out that he was on Arvala-7, which didn&rsquo;t make a lot of sense. But are all followers the same? Probably not.&nbsp;</p><p>Certainly the Mandalorian wasn&rsquo;t. He came back and collected Grogu and they left the other bounty hunters behind. Then they left more bounty hunters behind. Then they left people from the Mandalorian&rsquo;s past behind. Then, they left both other Mandalorians and whole lot more ex-Imps behind.&nbsp;</p><p>So traveling together isn&rsquo;t really the same as being a leader or a follower with some minor exceptions. Grogu was never given an option of which planet they should head for, which tended to favor the notion that the Mandalorian was the leader. On the other hand, the selections had all been about protecting Grogu as much as possible, which tended to favor that notion that he was the leader, because followers tended to protect their leaders from all manner of harm.</p><p>That was certainly the case with Fennec Shand and Boba Fett. Fennec protected the Daimyo from all sorts of bad actors. The assassin sent by the Hutts. The assassin sent by the former mayor of Mos Espa. The Pyke syndicate because they wanted to continue to run spice through Tatooine. Their followers who happened to be all over Mos Espa. But then the Daimyo had to protect himself from that other bounty hunter, Cad Bane. Fennec was busy with other things, as was his dad, who was kind of following the Daimyo, but not really following him. It was strange.</p><p>The Mandalorian had found the Daimyo&rsquo;s armor on Tatooine. Marshal Vanth had it. In trade for dealing with that Krayt dragon that was terrorizing the town, Vanth gave it to Din Djarin. Apparently Boba Fett found out about it from the Tuskens or somehow, who knew, but then they made a deal over it on Tython when the ex-Imps sent the Dark Troopers after Grogu and then fought with the two Mandalorians and Fennec. Because Boba Fett hadn&rsquo;t been successful at protecting Grogu he felt like he owed something to Grogu&rsquo;s protector. Of course Grogu didn&rsquo;t know that because he was playing Toss &rsquo;n Imp on Moff Gideon&rsquo;s ship.&nbsp;</p><p>When they cam back and rescued him with help from Cara Dune and Bo-Katan, Grogu figured the debts were all paid, but they weren&rsquo;t. The Mandalorian convinced him to go to Luke&rsquo;s Jedi Sleep Away Camp and then, somehow, ended up back on Tatooine, helping the Daimyo and getting Marshal Vanth and the fine people of Freetown to help as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Now they were all together and it was clear that Daimyo Fett, Fennec, CobbVanth, Grogu&rsquo;s dad, and even Bo-Katan, were each leaders in their own ways. Grogu knew he&rsquo;d rather follow Fett than Kryze, but in the meantime he was just going to stick with his dad who seemed to be a master in his own right at both following and leading. If Grogu was going to be a leader he wanted to be that kind. The kind where people didn&rsquo;t even realize they were following you while you walked along beside them. That was the Way.&nbsp;</p><figure class=""tmblr-full""><img src=""https://64.media.tumblr.com/37461c748eb16f7a32cc19adf7d3d27b/879d834fc5b2742a-bb/s640x960/f7bd5fe1f859f91c942fae45cfd1114e81226948.jpg"" alt=""image"" class=""""/></figure><p>Image of Boba Fett and 8D8 standing next to a holo-display of Mos Espa, while Fennec Shand looks on, in the throne room of Boba's palace on Tatooine.

Once he worked for Jabba the Hutt. Then for Bib Fortuna. He could have just agreed to work for Daimyo Fett. But no. He didn&rsquo;t. He told the Daimyo and Fennec one thing and then did another. Administrator Shand sorted him out. Don&rsquo;t be like Dokk Strassi.&rdquo;</p><p>Grogu watched the short vid and sighed. He appreciated that the Mods were new to developing public service announcements and other civic minded communications. They were trying to rally the people of Mos Espa and the rest of Tatooine to assist with the rebuilding of both the structural elements of the city and the planetary values they would all live under.&nbsp;</p><p>Grogu had giggled at the first PSA they showed him. It was a vid of Mos Espa with the Ranky crashing through a courtyard structure while throwing a land speeder across the city. They had captioned it &ldquo;Making way for a better Mos Espa&rdquo;. Grogu thought that they should have called it &ldquo;Rancor Demolition and Improvements. Nothing gets in our way.&rdquo; It was both accurate and funny.&nbsp;</p><p>He mentioned the PSAs to Peli the next time he saw her and she laughed and said they should have said, &lsquo;Mos Espa, at least it&rsquo;s not a hive of scum and villainy like Mos Eisley&rsquo;. While Grogu appreciated the sentiment, since he&rsquo;d met many villains in Mos Eisley, he didn&rsquo;t think it set the right tone.&nbsp;</p><p>The point was not to say that Mos Espa was better than Mos Eisley or Freetown or Anchorhead or Mos Kadhus, or anywhere else on Tatooine, but that the Daimyo and Fennec were making a large number of improvements across the planet and everyone benefited from them.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Listen kid, you&rsquo;re cute and have a wonderful smile, but if all these improvements go through we&rsquo;ll end up with a different class of visitor to Mos Eisley. You know, smarter ones and then where will I be?&rdquo; Peli had complained at him. &ldquo;You gotta be careful in what you ask for. We get too nice and all those &lsquo;friendly&rsquo; games of Sabacc that I clean up on will end. You don&rsquo;t want that, do ya?&rdquo;</p><p>Grogu shook his head. Of course he didn&rsquo;t want to hurt Peli in any way. He did think that she could maybe change just a little and maybe run one or two fewer scams on people. You know, just for a change of pace.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Kid, that would be changing the culture of Tatooine and do we really want that? I don&rsquo;t think so. Where would my marks, uh, er, customers go if they thought this planet was suddenly all on the up and up? Trask? Uff. We don&rsquo;t want those guys to get our business! Criminny! I&rsquo;d be out of a job and out of a garage and who would feed my poor little ones? Pit droids don&rsquo;t just feed themselves.&rdquo;</p><p>At that moment the three pit droids were refilling their own lubricant levels and chatted back to her that they did that every day.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! Don&rsquo;t confuse me with the facts. Change is hard. Can&rsquo;t change too quickly. Makes people afraid. Change too slow and other things happen that mess it up. Don&rsquo;t change at all and you&rsquo;re just fine. Listen to me, I know a thing or two.&rdquo;</p><p>Well, Peli wasn&rsquo;t wrong about that. At least about the change part. Change was hard. You had to learn new things and then teach the next group the new things and then change the system so the new thing was the thing and by the time you did all that (including documentation - blech), you had to change everything again. It was an endless cycle.&nbsp;</p><p>Grogu had to sit down. Just the thought of that was making him dizzy.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Buddy, don&rsquo;t worry about Peli so much. She&rsquo;s smart enough to learn how to take advantage of any rules anyone comes up with. She had to be to survive here. And look at the Mandalorians&hellip; they had to accept change and they&rsquo;re doing pretty well. Axe Woves just sent me a transmission and they&rsquo;re about to reopen the old Smash Ball arena. That&rsquo;s some positive change. It just takes time and people need to want the change. That makes it easier. Right now, Mandalorians want anything that can make Mandalore seem like home again.&rdquo;</p><p>His dad, the Mandalorian, was right. Home and hearth were really good selling points for change. The next time he saw the Mods he was going to share a vid with them and caption it &lsquo;Mos Espa, the place your heart calls home&rsquo; and see if that helped. It couldn&rsquo;t be worse than the vid of Ranky tearing things apart&hellip; as long as he selected a good vid. Something nice. Something homey. Something that totally didn&rsquo;t show a rancor ripping the place apart. That should be easy.

Among all this hustle and bustle, two female aliens were walking side-by-side past workers, droids and fighter crew; Hera Syndulla and Ahsoka Tano. And right now, neither was able to resist the little glances they were sending each other.</p><p>Ahsoka just couldn&rsquo;t get enough of how that fleece-collared jacket so snugly fit Hera&rsquo;s lithe frame, whilst enhancing the sheer authority the tall, ravishingly gorgeous Twi&rsquo;lek held over her fellow Republic military. Hera herself couldn&rsquo;t keep herself from blushing at the way Ahsoka&rsquo;s lips would morph into cocky little smirks, her orange face wreathed with white markings beaming with a playfulness she had never truly abandoned even after what she had gone through during conflicts against the Separatists and the Empire. </p><p>Something told both Republic pilot and force-wielder that the amount of times one had been eyeing the other as they walked on was increasing relentlessly. Not that they minded even the smallest bit. Twi&rsquo;lek and Togruta were just itching to caress one another&rsquo;s lekku, to pull at flight uniform and battle outfit, to kiss hungrily and possibly never part their rich, full lips. But right now, neither Ahsoka nor Hera could do any of these, not in the midst of all these people and droids around them. Boots clicking briskly across the floor, the deprivation left them simply starved for contact, yearning to sate the temptations tugging at them both physically and emotionally. </p><p>It was Ahsoka who quickly looked around herself, checking for any pilot or mechanic who might notice her and tuning into her Force sensitivity just to be sure. Now could be the right moment, so she decided to chance it. </p><p>Once they had reached a somewhat less-crowded part of the hangar, Ahsoka homed in on Hera, her round, plump derri&egrave;re bulging under her orange bodysuit like a pair of ripe meilooruns clear in her sights and made her move. In one swift whoosh, Ahsoka gave Hera a quick, sharp smack on the bottom!   </p><p>&lsquo;WHAP!&rsquo; </p><p>The sting of Ahsoka&rsquo;s hand on Hera&rsquo;s buttocks made her gasp and freeze mid-walk, her face turning as hot as an overloaded power converter! She turned to Ahsoka with her mouth agape in pure shock, the Togruta gleefully smirking back at her with her eyes twinkling wickedly. After a second (or two) of this paralysis, her bum stinging from that slap, Hera felt her lips tugging at the edges. Next she and Ahsoka ended up bursting into fits of giggles, their laughter now impossible to suppress for much longer. The two looked away as they tried with all their might to compose themselves, but at this point, it was like water falling from a collapsed dam. A military hangar was by far a less-than-appropriate place to perform such intimate gestures, and Hera knew she could easily call Ahsoka out on this. But she didn&rsquo;t, grinning back at the Togruta who still wore a smirk of unapologetic mischief. Even Ahsoka knew that neither she nor the Twi&rsquo;lek general could deny just how much they relished the scandalousness of that slap she had dared to do. Not wanting to raise any suspicions, the two resumed their journey through the hangar even as they attempted to wrestle down their grins and sniggering. Apart from some brief turning of heads from pilots or mechanics walking past, it did seem to Ahsoka and Hera that they might have - just might have - got away with that little prank. As far as Ahsoka could see, Kanan, Force rest his soul, had always been on to something with Hera, in more ways than one&hellip; </p></p>",8,0,0
